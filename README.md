## Desicions

- Vite : Absolutely faster!
- MUI : I have worked with MUI in many projects . It is one of the most popular library for UI components . It is also suitable for the projects that we have limited time to complete.I used styled components and sx that helped me to handle in short time.I would prefer tailwind or writing scss for huge projects but in this kind of assignments MUI helped a lot.
- react-beautiful-dnd : Easy to use library for Drag&Drop .Absolutely perfect match for this project.
- react-testing-library - jest
- jest-fetch-mock : Helped a lot while mocking fetch.
- json-server :Always best choices for mocking server.
